# Unit 3. Classifying matter

---
### Chemical substances and mixtures
- A **chemical substance** is a type of matter that has **constant chemical composition** and characteristic properties.
- A **mixture** is made up by two or more chemical substances and it **does not have a definite composition**.

---
### Types of mixtures
- **Homogeneus**. The composition is uniform, having the same apperance and properties in all the portions.
- **Heterogeneous**. The compositions is not uniform, so their portions have different apperance and properties. 
- **Colloid**. Heterageneous mixture that seems homogeneous at first sight.

--- 
### Solutions
- Solutions are a homogeneous mixture.
- Two components can be distiguised:
    - **Solute**. The component present in smaller amount.
    - **Solvent**. Component present in greater amount.

- A substance is **soluble** if it is able to be dissolved in a particular solvent.
- The physical state of a solution depend on the physical state of the solvent.

 solute\solvent | solid | liquid | gas
--- | --- | --- | ---
solid | alloys (steel, bronze,...) | sea water | none
liquid | gold/mercury amalgam | gasoline, beer, wine | none
gas | Hydrogen in metals | soft drinks, home ammonia | air

### Concentration of a solution

- Relationship between the amount of solute and the amount of solvent.
- It can be expressed in several ways (for liquids and gases):
    - **Grams per litre**: $c(g/L)=\ \frac{mass\ of\ solute\ (g)}{volume\ of\ solution\ (L)}$
    - **Mass percentage**: $\%\  mass = \frac{m_{solute}(g)}{m_{solution}(g)} \times 100$
    - **Volume %**: $\%\  volume = \frac{v_{solute}(mL)}{v_{solution}(mL)} \times 100$

## Procedures for the separation of mixtures

---
### Separation of a heterogeneous mixture

#### Mixture of an insoluble solid in a liquid

1. Decanting
2. Filtration

#### Mixture of two solids
1. Magnetic separation
2. Sublimation
3. Dissolving and filtering
